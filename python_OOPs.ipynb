        " 1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around objects, or data, instead of logic and functions.\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a template that defines the methods and variables for a specific type of object. Classes are a fundamental concept in OOP and are used to create and manage objects.\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- An object is a component of a program that has unique attributes and behaviors, and can interact with other elements of the program.\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- Abstraction\n",
        "Hides complex implementation details and exposes only the essential functionalities.\n",
        "Encapsulation\n",
        "Restricts direct access to some components of an object. Encapsulation secures data and functions within a class, preventing unauthorized access and modification.\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- Dunder methods, also known as magic methods or special methods, are predefined methods in Python that allow you to customize the behavior of objects and classes.\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "Ans- Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class.\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- Polymorphism is a core concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common superclass.\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- In Python, encapsulation is achieved by using access modifiers and property decorators to restrict access to a class's methods and variables.\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- In Python, a constructor is a special method that's automatically called when an object of a class is created.\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- A class method takes cls as the first parameter while a static method needs no specific parameters.\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- Method overloading is a concept in Python that allows a single function to handle multiple input types or parameters.\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- Method overloading is a concept in Python that allows a single function to handle multiple input types or parameters.\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "Ans- A decorator feature in Python wraps in a function, appends several functionalities to existing code and then returns it.\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- It allows for more efficient code, improved readability, and easier extensibility.\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- In Python, an abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is used as a blueprint for other classes.\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- Object-oriented programming (OOP) has many advantages, including:\n",
        "Modularity\n",
        "\n",
        "OOP allows developers to divide complex systems into smaller, more manageable objects. This makes troubleshooting and collaboration easier.\n",
        "\n",
        "Reusability\n",
        "\n",
        "OOP allows developers to reuse code through inheritance, which saves time and effort.\n",
        "\n",
        "Flexibility\n",
        "\n",
        "OOP's polymorphism feature allows a single function to adapt to the class it's in.\n",
        "\n",
        "Security\n",
        "OOP's encapsulation feature bundles data inside objects, making the code more secure.\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-  class variables are shared by all instances of a class, while instance variables are unique to each instance.\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- In Python, multiple inheritance is when a class is derived from more than one superclass. This allows a child class to inherit all the properties and methods from multiple parent classes.\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-In Python, the __str__ and __repr__ methods are used to define how an object is represented as a string:\n",
        "\n",
        "str-\n",
        "Returns a human-readable string representation of an object. This method is called when the print(), str(), or format() functions are used. It's intended for users.\n",
        "\n",
        "repr-\n",
        "Returns a more information-rich string representation of an object. This method is called when the repr() function is used or when an object is displayed in the interactive shell.\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-The super() function in Python is a built-in function that allows access to methods and properties of a parent class from a child class.\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-The del method in Python, also known as a destructor method, is used to manage resource cleanup when an object is destroyed.\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- In Python, the main difference between @classmethod and @staticmethod is that class methods take the class as the first argument, while static methods do not.\n",
        "23.  How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- Polymorphism and inheritance in Python work together by allowing child classes to have methods with the same name as their parent class, while also allowing the child class to modify or replace those methods.\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- In Python object-oriented programming (OOP), method chaining is a technique for calling multiple methods on an object in a single line of code.\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-The purpose of the __call__ method in Python is to allow programmers to write classes that behave like functions:\n",
        "The __call__ method allows instances of a class to be called like functions.\n",
